Support Vector Machine

Quite a popular machine learning algorithm. Considered the best
back in the 90s.

It separates groups into 1 by 1 ... group
Groups are positive 1 or negative 1. Find best separating hyperplane

SVM can determine the best separating hyperplane out of all
Once found, you can take in unknown data.

Use to separate 1 from the rest (Binary data)
So if you have classifications. You identify, separate 1 classification
from the rest of the classifications
